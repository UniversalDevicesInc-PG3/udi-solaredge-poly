## Configuration

The SolarEdge node server requires a valid API key to access your site
infomation.  You can obtain an API key by logging into your SolarEdge
monitoring account.  From your monitoring dashboard select "Admin" and go to 
the "Site Access" section.  Near the bottom of the page is a section to
enable API access and get an API key.

Copy the API key to the api_key custom parameter below.
